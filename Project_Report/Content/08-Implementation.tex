\section{Implementation}

The method of using a shunt resistor was chosen to measure the energy consumption because of its simple design which lets the student threat the system as a black box. The other measurment and estimation techniques where either too complex or didnt have a low enough error rate. Figure \ref{fig:deploy} shows the deployment diagram of the rig that is used to measure the energy consumption of the GPS reciever.

The measurement setup consist of the LoPy microcontroller along with the Pytrack from Pycom, the Picoscope 640AD from picotech, a shunt resistor, and a laptop. The platform is mounted inside a box on a cycle wagon to make the platform mobile. The following section will explain the role of each part in platform.
