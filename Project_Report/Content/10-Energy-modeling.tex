 \chapter{Energy Model}
 To optimally use the GPS receiver, we need an model that can predict the energy consumption of the system. In the first subsection, we will first analyze the data from the measurements. In the next subsection, we will present a parameter exploration for the energy model and finally, we will present the model. 
 \section{Data analysis}
 The first step in making an energy model of the GPS receiver is to analyze the data from the measurements and relating it to the theory. The theory section explains how the receiver operates between two distinct phases: acquisition and tracking. The two phases for a receiver can be modelled in a state diagram.

\label{fig:GPS reciever}
\end{figure}
The receiver will transition to the acquisition state once the update period is set. It will transition from the acquisition state to tracking state once it has acquired a signal from at least four satellites. 
The trigger functionality from table \ref{Table:wifioff} highlights when the receiver has a positional fix. We know from the theory, that the receiver switches to the tracking phase, once it acquires a positional fix. The GPS receiver is therefore in tracking phase the instant the trigger is set. The trigger functionality can't however, inform about later transitions because the receiver changes phases after it has a positional fix to maintain the signal strength. A table with the data of the current consumption right before and after the trigger is set, is generated in an acquisition and a tracking column respectively. The average of each phase is calculated.  Average value of the acquisition and tracking phase is calculated to 80 mA and 72 mA respectively.

Figure \ref{fig:averageacq} shows the scatter plot of the average current consumption during the Acquisition phase.

\label{fig:averageacq}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:averagetrack} shows the scatter plot of the average current consumption during the tracking phase.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=15 cm]{Project_Report/Images/trackingData.PNG}
\caption{The average values for tracking phase in a scatter plot }
\label{fig:averagetrack}
\end{figure}
 
The scatter plots shows how the current consumption is decreasing in the later samples for both phases. The schematics from figure \ref{fig:LoPy_Schematic} shows that the LoPy is using a LiPo battery for voltage supply. Rechargeable batteries  tend to have a discharge curve, which means that the battery voltage changes during discharge. This affect might be the cause of the deviating voltage values in the later measurements. 

The average values are compared with the features from the datasheet \cite{L76}. The datasheet state that it should be a 7 mA difference between the acquisition and tracking phase. This seems to validate the measurements, which shows a decreasing in current consumption from 80 mA to 72 mA after a positional fix.   
\section{Parameter exploration}
The next step in developing an model is to determine which parameters that the model should be dependent on. The parameters in the model will determine the accuracy and abstraction level of the model. We decided to make a simple model with few parameters because of the limited project time.

Based on the theory, we know that the time used in the acquisition state varies accordingly to the validity of the satellite data and signal strength to the satellite. To develop a simple model, we do an optimistic assumption that the time used in acquisition is only dependent on satellite data, and therefore equal to either 35s, 30s or 1s from the specification\cite{L76}. Validity of satellite data is for this reason a parameter for the model. We also assume that the receiver does not switch between the acquisition state and tracking state after acquiring a fix, even if it's kept in tracking state. 

Another parameter is the enabling of deepsleep. The receiver can either be kept in tracking phase continuously or it can be put to deepsleep between update periods. Deepsleep introduces an overhead which consist of initializing the receiver and acquiring signal strength between each updating period. It may therefore exist a scenario where it is better to have continuously fix in tracking, instead of using deepsleep. 

The state diagram in figure \ref{fig:GPS energymodel} is an extension of the general state diagram from figure \ref{fig:GPS reciever}. The state diagram is extended with a deepsleep state and an internal transition if the receiver is kept in tracking state. Timeouts are used for setting time constraints for acquiring a positional fix.

\section{The model}
We can derive a prediction of the energy cost of acquiring a fix, by using the state diagram from \ref{fig:GPS energymodel}. The prediction will highlight which update period that is beneficial for having an optimal energy strategy. 
 
The python script in appendix \ref{Appendix:make_energy_model.py} use the method that is derived in this subsection to predict the energy consumption over a range of update periods and durations. An update period is defined as the time from the microcontroller get a request until the next request. The energy consumption over an update period is:
\begin{equation}
E_{period} = P_{period}*T_{period}
\end{equation}
During an update period, the microcontroller transitions between the states in figure \ref{fig:GPS energymodel}. The total energy consumption $E_{fixperiod}$ can therefore be written as the sum of the energy of each state:

\begin{equation}
E_{period} = P_{Initialize}*T_{Initialize} + P_{Acquisition}*T_{Acquisition} + P_{Tracking}*T_{Tracking} + P_{Deepsleep}*T_{Deepsleep}
\end{equation}
If the microcontroller is kept in tracking, the energy used in initialize, acquisition and deepsleep is 0. We omit the initial energy used in initialize and acquisition for the first fix, because it becomes insignificant over a long duration.  

The time used in deepsleep in an update period is dependent on the overhead of waking the microcontroller from deepsleep and acquiring a fix:
\begin{equation}
T_{Deepsleep} = T_{fixperiod} - T_{Initialize} - T_{Acquisition} - T_{Tracking}
\end{equation}
$T_ {Acquisition}$ depends on the validity of satellite data which is given by the fix\_period. The total energy consumption over a duration t is given by the energy consumption of a fix period multiplied by the number of periods during the total duration t.

\begin{equation}
 E_{total} = E_{fixperiod}* \frac{t}{fixperiod}
\end{equation}
\label{equation: energyequation}

 We can use the data from the measurement chapter and calculate the power consumption for each state. This is shown in table  \ref{Table:data for the energy model}. The power is also plotted in a pie diagram in figure \ref{fig:powerconsumption}
\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{||c c||} 
 \hline
  State &  Power(W) \\ [0.5ex] 
 \hline\hline
  Initialize & 10.201 \\ 
 \hline

 \hline

\includegraphics[height=7.5cm]{Project_Report/Images/powerconsump.PNG}
\caption{The pie diagram of the power in table \ref{Table:data for the energy model}}
\label{fig:powerconsumption}
\end{figure}

The pie diagram shows how the majority of the power is associated with the initializing of the microcontroller. The second biggest contribution to power consumption is the acquisition state, followed by the tracking state. The power consumption in deepsleep is insignificant compared to the other states, which further encourage the use of deepsleep as a power saving strategy. The energy consumption over 1 year with a range of update periods included in table \ref{Table:data for the energy model}. The table is derived by using equation \ref{equation: energyequation}.

\section{Energy Analysis}

The pie diagram from \ref{fig:powerconsumption} doesn't identify the energy demand of each state. The energy consumption of a state depends on the time that it's active. We know from equation \ref{equation: energyequation} that it's only the time used in acquisition and deepsleep that varies. All the other times in our model is static. The time used in acquisition is an important factor for energy consumption. As explained in the theory chapter, the receiver can be in of three scenarios: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Hot start: valid Ephemeris \& valid Almanac. Time used in acquisition: 1 s. This is the scenario when the update period is  [1,14399] seconds.
    \item Warm start: invalid Ephemeris \& valid Almanac. Time used in acquisition: 30 s. This is the scenario when the update period is between [14400,15551700] seconds.
    \item Cold start: invalid Ephemeris \& invalid Almanac. Time used in acquisition: 35 s. This is the scenario when the update period is [15551700, $\infty$ ] seconds. 
\end{itemize}

We suspect that the energy consumption of each state will vary for each scenario, since the time in acquisition state varies. 

\subsection{Valid Ephemeris \& valid Almanac}

Figure \ref{fig:firstcase} shows the energy consumption over a duration of 1 year when the update period is 14399 seconds. Th pie diagram shows the contribution from each state to the energy consumption. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=7.5cm]{Project_Report/Images/Allvalid.PNG}
\caption{The energy consumption over 1 year with an update period of 14399 seconds}
\label{fig:firstcase}
\end{figure}

The GPS receiver uses only 1 second in the acquisition state because of the validity of the satellite data. This makes the initializing state, the main factor for the energy consumption. The receiver spends a small amount of time in deepsleep because of the high update frequency. This makes the deepsleep an insignificant contributor to the energy consumption. 

\subsection{Invalid Ephemeris \& valid Almanac}
Figure \ref{fig:secondcase} shows the energy contribution over 1 year for each state when the update period is 14400 seconds. An update period of [14400,15551700] s will make the Ephemeris invalid.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=7.5cm]{Project_Report/Images/invalidvalid.PNG}
\caption{The energy consumption over 1 year with an update period of 14400 seconds}
\label{fig:secondcase}
\end{figure}

Comparing figure \ref{fig:firstcase} with figure \ref{fig:secondcase}, we can see that the major energy consumer isn't the initializes state but the acquisition state. This is because of the added time penalty of waiting 30 s instead of 1 s in acquisition state. The added time penalty comes from time used in acquisition to download a valid Ephemeris. The update frequency is high, which makes the receiver spend a small time in deepsleep. This makes deepsleep an insignificant part of the energy consumption.  

\subsection{Invalid Ephemeris \& invalid Almanac}

The energy consumption of each state when both the Ephemeris and Almanac is invalid is show in figure \ref{fig:thirdcase}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=7.5cm]{Project_Report/Images/invalidinvalid.PNG}
\caption{The energy consumption over 1 year with an update period of 15551700 s}
\label{fig:thirdcase}
\end{figure}

The pie diagram in figure \ref{fig:thirdcase} is different from the figure \ref{fig:firstcase} and figure \ref{fig:secondcase}, in that the major energy consumption is during deepsleep. This is because of the low update frequency which cause the system to spend the majority of its time in deepsleep.
